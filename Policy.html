<h1 style="font-family: 'Baloo Bhaina', cursive;"> Payment Policy </h1>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo Bhaina', cursive;"> All payments for commission work are done in US Dollars through the payment service PayPal. There are no alternate payment methods. When you go to send money on PayPal, please select the option 'Pay for goods or services'. <br>
<br>Payment for order signifies that I can begin working on your order. No full refunds will be given. Partial refunds are possible, however not guaranteed based on the circumstances. <br>

<br>You must send the full payment for a commission order through before I begin any work. This is a standard policy among graphics designers, if you have any doubt to my legitimacy, you can contact me and I can provide you with reputable references people I've done work for.<br>

<br>If you are placing a large order, I can understand the concern for paying a large amount of money up front. I am willing to this concern, with the following policy in place. If you are placing an order of more than $50 USD, you only have to pay half the price of the order up front. When I finish the work, I will provide screenshots of the work with a watermark. You will receive the full quality images after I receive the second half of the payment.

<h1 style="font-family: 'Baloo Bhaina', cursive;"> <br>Commission Policy </h1>

<h3 style="font-family: 'Baloo Bhaina', cursive;"> All commission work for an order will begin after payment. Orders containing 1-2 items should usually be done within 3-5 days. Larger orders containing 3-5+ items may take multiple weeks based on circumstances and complexity. You will be updated through every step of the order.<br>

<br>If you have strict deadlines to meet, I will do everything in my power to make sure there are no delays. <br>

<br>If there are changes or tweaks you'd like me to make to a previous work, I'm willing to do so, and accommodate to what you want. However, if a "change" or "tweak" sounds to be like a complete redesign or overhaul, I may ask you to submit a new order or for a small payment to compensate for the time it will take, this rarely happens, but it all comes down to how long these things take. I must emphasize, this only will occur if the change you are requesting is massive, comparatively speaking. </h3>
